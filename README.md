# AI-powered Autonomous Testing Platform

The platform is not a single AI related test tool or solution. It’s a whole set  of AI plus techniques and solutions for each software test life cycle.  Person or enterprise can take and assemble the techniques and solutions from the platform (AATP) to implement autonomous tests in their own environments.

**Continuously embracing new technologies to achieve AI-driven the tests without human intervention**

## What is Autonomous Test?

“Completely Autonomous Test” means AI will fully control the whole STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) and take responsible for each stage of testing.

## Value

- Low latency on defect finding
- Low cost
- 7 * 24 hour continuous working
- Find issues for human difficult to cover 
- Things robots do better than humans ([5-things-robots-better-humans/](https://www.therobotreport.com/5-things-robots-better-humans/))

## Mission
- *Stage 0. Without AI, the test automation rate has not been reached to 100% (Current)*
- Stage 1. AI-assisted testing with human intervention implement  100% automation
- Stage 2. AI analyze requirement, test plan and code generation with human guidance
- Stage 3. AI fully drive test itself without human supervision
