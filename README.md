# AI-powered Autonomous Testing Platform (AATP)

## Introduction
The platform is not a single AI related test tool or solution. It’s a whole set  of AI plus techniques and solutions for each software test life cycle to achieve **autonomous test**.  Person or enterprise can take and assemble the techniques and solutions from the (AATP) platform to implement autonomous tests in their own environments.

## Vision
**Continuously embracing new technologies to achieve AI-driven the tests without human intervention**

## What is Autonomous Test?
Manual => Automation => Autonomy

“Completely Autonomous Test” means AI will fully control the whole STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) and take responsible for each stage of testing.

## Value

- Low latency on defect finding
- Low cost
     - 7 * 24 hour continuous working
- Find diverse issues difficult for human to cover 
- Things AIs and robots do better than humans

## Mission
- *Stage 0. Without AI, the test automation rate has not been reached to 100% (Current)*
- Stage 1. AI-assisted testing with human intervention implement  100% automation
- Stage 2. AI analyze requirement, test plan and code generation with human guidance
- Stage 3. AI fully drive test itself without human supervision
